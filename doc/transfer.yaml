# counter_name: Unique counter on target server to use for recording source changes processed. No spaces.
#    Name sensibly if you have multiple instances transferring into the same target p4 repository.
#    The counter value represents the last transferred change number - script will start from next change.
#    If not set, or 0 then transfer will start from first change.
counter_name: p4transfer_counter

# instance_name: Name of the instance of P4Transfer - for emails etc. Spaces allowed.
instance_name: Perforce Transfer from XYZ

# For notification - if smtp not available - expects a pre-configured nms FormMail script as a URL
#   E.g. expects to post using 2 fields: subject, message
# Alternatively, use the following entries (suitable adjusted) to use Mailgun for notifications
#   api: "<Mailgun API key"
#   url: "https://api.mailgun.net/v3/<domain or sandbox>"
#   mail_from: "Fred <fred@example.com>"
#   mail_to:

# valid python expression which evaluates to integer value, e.g.
#     "24 * 60"
#     "7 * 24 * 60"

# error_report_interval (Integer): Interval (in minutes) between error emails being sent e.g. connection error
#     Usually some value less than report_interval. Useful if transfer being run with --repeat option.
error_report_interval: 15

# summary_report_interval (Integer): Interval (in minutes) between summary emails being sent e.g. changes processed
#     Typically some value such as 1 week (10080 = 7 * 24 * 60). Useful if transfer being run with --repeat option.

# change_description_format: The standard format for transferred changes.
#    Keywords prefixed with $. Use \\n for newlines. Keywords allowed:
#     $sourceDescription, $sourceChange, $sourcePort, $sourceUser
change_description_format: $sourceDescription\n\nTransferred from p4://$sourcePort@$sourceChange

# change_map_file: Name of an (optional) CSV file listing mappings of source/target changelists.
#    If this is blank (DEFAULT) then no mapping file is created.
#    If non-blank, then a file with this name in the target workspace is appended to
#    and will be submitted after every sequence (batch_size) of changes is made.
#    Default type of this file is text+CS32 to avoid storing too many revisions.
#    File must be mapped into target client workspace.
#    File can contain a sub-directory, e.g. change_map/change_map.csv
#    Note that due to the way client workspace views are created the local filename
#    should include a valid source path including depot name, e.g.
#       //depot/export/... -> depot/export/change_map.csv
change_map_file:

# superuser: Set to n if not a superuser (so can't update change times - can just transfer them).
superuser: y

# ignore_files: An array of regex patterns which are used to ingore any matching files.
#    Allows you to ignore some issues which cause transfer problems.
#    E.g.
#    ignore_files:
#    - "some/files/to/*ignore$"
ignore_files:

    # P4USER to use
  p4user:
    # P4CLIENT to use, e.g. p4-transfer-client
  p4client:
    # P4PASSWD for the user - valid password. If blank then no login performed.
    # Recommended to make sure user is in a group with a long password timeout!.
    # Make sure your P4TICKETS file is correctly found in the environment
  p4passwd:
    # P4CHARSET to use, e.g. none, utf8, etc - leave blank for non-unicode p4d instance

# workspace_root: Root directory to use for both client workspaces.
#    This will be used to update the client workspace Root: field for both source/target workspaces
#    They must be the same.
#    Make sure there is enough space to hold the largest single changelist that will be transferred!
workspace_root: /work/transfer

# views: An array of source/target view mappings
#    You are not allowed to specify both 'views' and 'stream_views' - leave one or other blank!!
#    Each value is a string - normally quote. Standard p4 wildcards are valid.
#    These values are used to construct the appropriate View: fields for source/target client workspaces
#    It is allowed to have exclusion mappings - by specifying the '-' as first character in 'src'
#    entry - see last example below.
views:
- src: //depot/source_path1/...
  targ: //import/target_path1/...
- src: //depot/source_path2/...
  targ: //import/target_path2/...
- src: -//depot/source_path2/exclude/*.tgz
  targ: //import/target_path2/exclude/*.tgz

# transfer_target_stream: The name of a special target stream to use - IT SHOULD NOT CONTAIN FILES!!
#    This will be setup as a mainline stream, with no sharing and with import+ mappings
#    It is in standard stream name format, e.g. //<depot>/<name> or //<depot>/<mid>/<name>
#    e.g. transfer_target_stream: //targ_streams/transfer_target
transfer_target_stream:

# stream_views: An array of source/target stream view mappings and other record fields.
#    You are not allowed to specify both 'views' and 'stream_views' - leave one or other blank
#    Each src/targ value is a string with '*' p4 wildcards to match stream names (like 'p4 streams //depot/rel*')
#    Multiple wildcards are allowed, but make sure the number of wildcards matches between source and target.
#    Please note that target depots must exist.
#    Target streams will be created as required using the specified type/parent fields.
#    Field 'type:' has allowed values: mainline, development, release
#    Field 'parent:' should specify a suitable parent if you are creating development or release streams.
stream_views:
- src: //streams_src/main

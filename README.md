# p4transfer
Utility for transferring a subset of files (with complete history of all changelists) from one Helix Core repository to another, only requiring read access to the source repository.

## Overview

The script `P4Transfer.py` is for use when transferring changes between two Perforce Servers (one way).

## Requirements

This requires Python (2.7 or 3.6+) and P4Python (2017.2+). It runs on Linux/Mac/Windows.

## Documentation

See [doc/P4Transfer.adoc](doc/P4Transfer.adoc) for more details on how it works and how to use it. You can also download [P4Transfer.pdf](doc/P4Transfer.pdf)

This includes:

*   When to use p4d-native P4DVCS commands instead of P4Transfer
*   Detailed configuration and usage
*   How to ask for support

## Support

P4Transfer is a community supported project and is not officially supported by Perforce.

Pull requests and issues are the responsibility of the project's moderator(s); this may be a vetted individual or team with members outside of the Perforce organization.
Perforce does not officially support these projects, therefore all issues should be reported and managed via GitHub (not via Perforce's standard support process).

## Build/Usage
See Documentation link above.
